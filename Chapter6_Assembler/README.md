## ‚úÖ Strengths

* **Modular Design**
  You cleanly separated concerns into three modules‚Äîcode translation (`code.c`/`code.h` ), parsing (`parser.c`/`parser.h` ), and symbol table management (`symbolTable.c`/`symbolTable.h` ). This makes each piece easier to test and maintain.

* **Comprehensive Mnemonic Coverage**
  Your `dest_c`, `comp_c`, and `jump_c` functions cover all Hack mnemonics, ensuring correctness for standard programs .

* **Verbose Logging for Debugging**
  The `printf` statements throughout `Hack_Assembler.c`  and parser give clear insight into the assembler‚Äôs state at each step, which is invaluable during development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

1. **Error Handling & Input Validation**

   * You check `fopen` for `NULL` but proceed without an exit code. Consider exiting immediately with an error message to avoid undefined behavior if files fail to open .
   * Validate `argc` and file extensions before any file I/O.

2. **Parser Comment Logic Bug**

   * In `advance()`, the check

     ```c
     if ((currentCommand[i] == '/') && currentCommand[i] == '/')
     ```

     always tests the same character twice. You need to detect the two-character sequence `//` (e.g., `currentCommand[i] == '/' && currentCommand[i+1] == '/'`) .

3. **Fixed-Size Buffers & Bounds Checking**

   * All buffers (`currentCommand[50]`, `symbol_dat[50]`, `dest_dat[4]`, etc.) are static. Without explicit bounds checks, a long line could overflow. Either increase sizes or use safer functions (e.g., `fgets` with exact limits and manual truncation).

4. **Symbol Table Hashing & Collision**

   * Your hash function in `symbolTable.c` uses two rolling sums but no collision resolution‚Äîso later symbols simply overwrite earlier ones . Consider chaining (linked lists) or open addressing with probing to handle collisions.

5. **Memory Management**

   * You `malloc` large tables (191453 entries) but never `free` them. Though the program is short-lived, adding `free` calls or using a more compact structure would improve hygiene.

6. **Magic Numbers & Configuration**

   * Numbers like `50`, `256`, `191453`, `159544`, etc., should be defined via `#define` or `const` variables with descriptive names to clarify their purpose.

7. **Code Duplication in `code.c`**

   * The long chain of `if/else` for mnemonics could be replaced by a static lookup table (e.g., an array of structs mapping strings to bit-patterns) and a single search routine, reducing repetition and risk of typos.

## üí° Suggestions & Next Steps

* **Refactor Parser**
  Use a single pass to strip comments and whitespace, perhaps with `strtok` or manual pointer arithmetic, and add a `verbose` flag to toggle debug output.

* **Improve Symbol Table**
  Switch to an open-addressing hash table (e.g., linear probing) or store chains at each bucket for robust symbol management.

* **Unit Tests**
  Create small test cases for each module: feed known mnemonics into `code.c`, sample lines into the parser, and symbol lookups into the table to automate correctness checks.

* **Documentation & Style**
  Add header comments explaining each function‚Äôs contract, and adopt a consistent naming convention (e.g., `camelCase` vs. `snake_case`) throughout.

With these refinements, your assembler will be more robust, maintainable, and scalable. Great work on a solid first cut‚Äîkeep iterating!
